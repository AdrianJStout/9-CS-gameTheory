<li>Game theory has a lot of uses; it's not just for playing games. Today we're going to use it to create and play a game. 
</li>
<li>We are going to learn about a concept called <b>backward induction</b> to solve <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game">zero-sum games</a></b>.
</li>
<li>Backward induction is the process of reasoning backwards in time, from the end of a problem or situation, to determine a sequence of optimal actions. It proceeds by first considering the last time a decision might be made and choosing what to do in any situation at that time. Using this information, one can then determine what to do at the second-to-last time of decision. This process continues backwards until one has determined the best action for every possible situation (i.e. for every possible information set) at every point in time.

<li>"Nim" is an ancient two-player game played with sticks or stones. The objects are divided into piles. 
</li>
<li>The players alternate turns. 
</li>
<li>On each player's turn they may remove any number of sticks from one of the piles, up to the number of sticks remaining in that pile; but they can only take from a single pile on a given turn. 
</li>
<li>The goal is to take the last stick, making you the winner. 
</li>
<li>The strategy element is to make the other person clear out all but one pile, so you can take all the sticks in that last pile.
</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To illustrate the basic theoretical idea behind the Nim strategy, let's first look at a simpler version of the game called "21". 
</li>
<li>Imagine there are 21 sticks in a pile. 
</li>
<li>The rules are: You can take one, two, or three sticks on your turn.
</li>
<li>Whoever takes the last stick on their turn wins.
</li>
<li>Try it <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/23781653/">here</a> as both a one and two player game a few times.

#Set the initial state
-make another variable called state and set to 21. We also need to let the user know what is the initial state, we can play with this number later to add to the game, and make a while loop to keep the game going.

<li>What is? A list of course! Make a list called 'validMove' and add 1,2 and 3 as elements.
</li>
<li>Can a player always pick 1-3? Not always. If we are approaching the end of the game there may be only 1 or two left. We'll need to add some code to check whether there are enough sticks left.

<li>By using the rules, we can write an AI that always wins. In game theory, a "no-win" situation is one in which no player benefits from any outcome. This may be because of any or all of the following:
-Unavoidable or unforeseeable circumstances causing the situation to change after decisions have been made. This is common in Text adventures
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Zugzwang, as in chess, when any move a player chooses makes him worse off than before but the rules of chess means they have to move
</li>
<li>A situation in which the player has to accomplish two mutually dependent tasks each of which must be completed before the other or that are mutually exclusive (a Catch-22)
</li>
<li>Ignorance of other players' actions, meaning the best decision for all differs from that for any one player (as in the Prisoner's Dilemma).
